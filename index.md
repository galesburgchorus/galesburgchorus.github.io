Galesburg Community Chorus was organized in 1945 to provide singers an opportunity
to participate in choral music in its larger forms and give the Galesburg community an
opportunity to enjoy great choral works. Now in its 74th season, the Chorus continues to
offer a tradition of choral excellence to both singers and audience members. Our mission
is to “share the gift of great choral music, to inspire new generations with the love of singing,
and to broaden our reach to all people.” Galesburg Community Chorus is supported by the
generosity of private donors, sponsors, local businesses, ticket sales, membership dues,
and grants. We also offer scholarships to college-bound high school seniors interested in
singing with the Chorus. For more information about singing with us, or if you would like to
make a tax-deductable contribution, contact us.

The Chorus rehearses in the Jay Rehearsal Hall in the Ford Center for Fine Arts at Knox College on Mondays at 7 pm. Auditions are not required.The next rehearsal starts August 27, 2018.
